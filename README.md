## Usage

This repository is private, so to install the library you will need SSH access or a personal access token (PAT) if SSH is not possible.

Add cruk-react-components and its peer dependencies react, react-dom and styled-components to your package.json file.

```sh
"dependencies": {
  "cruk-react-components": "git+https://github.com/CRUKorg/cruk-react-components.git",
  "react": "^16.2.0",
  "react-dom": "^16.2.0",
  "styled-components": "^5.0.0"
}
```

To use a personal access token, follow this link to [create a new personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=cruk-react-components) with the `repo` scope and add your token to the package URL. Replace `[INSERT TOKEN HERE]` with the token, including the `[]` brackets.

```sh
"dependencies": {
  "cruk-react-components": "git+https://[INSERT TOKEN HERE]:x-oauth-basic@github.com/CRUKorg/cruk-react-components.git"
}
```
