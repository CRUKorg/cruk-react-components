## Usage

---

Add cruk-react-components and its peer dependencies react, react-dom and styled-components to your package.json file.

```sh
"dependencies": {
  "react": "^16.2.0",
  "react-dom": "^16.2.0",
  "styled-components": "^5.0.0"
}
```

After an `npm i @cruk/cruk-react-components --save`, you can start importing components from the library:

```js
import { Button } from "cruk-react-components";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <Button />
  </div>
);
```

## Migration from V0 to V1

1.  Find all instances of RadioGroup and change it to the new component name of RadioConsent
2.  The old Button appearance="tertiary" has been removed and replaced with what was Button the old variant of appearance="text"

The suggested solution is to find all instance of appearance="tertiary" and replace it with appearance="secondary" and find all instances of appearance="text" and replace them with appearance="tertiary"
