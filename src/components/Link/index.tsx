 *
 * A link should really only be used for navigation to take a user to as new location.
 * The onClick handler can be use for more complicated scenarios.
 *
 * If you want something that looks like a link but behaves like a button ie. nothing to do with navigation, please consider using Link with as='button'

 * If you want something that looks like a button but behaves like a link ie. it takes the user to a new location, please consider using Button and simply passing it an href, it will automatically turn into a link. */
