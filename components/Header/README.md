# Header

There should be only on header component near or at the top of the body of each page.

### Logos

It is recommended that logo images are at least 80px high if they are not SVGs and that the logo is still clearly legible when reduced to 40px high for mobile.

It is also recommended that the logo width doesn't exceed 350px. If you need a wide logo that is shorter than 80px to keep the aspect ratio please make sure that the logo is centered with transparent space at the top and bottom and still 80px high.

### Header Text (optional)

This is a single line of text and the character limit depends on the theme, logo and children width.

### Right section (optional)

This has been kept quite open you can place any child elements in here but ideally it is narrow and its height is 50px or smaller.

### Try it out

```.jsx
  <React.Fragment>
    <Header></Header>
  </React.Fragment>
```
